As I was building things, I often found myself lacking in reaching space.
There are enough calculators but none which do what I'd want.

This tool should be able to calculate:
the amount of Hydrogen needed
thrust needed

TODO:

Grid sizes
Correct stats per item
Calculations
Gravity scaling
Hydrogen consumption (per engine)
Design the tool

As I was building things, I often found myself lacking in reaching space.
There are enough calculators but none which do what I'd want.
The aim is to make a calculator capable of doing everything that I want it to do, making it the most complete calculator.

This tool should be able to calculate thrust (acceleration and needed thrust) and consumption (hydrogen, oxygen, power).

TODO:
Inventory multipliers/settings
Maybe make a list of all generic fields/items. Then calculate all possible stats from the filled in fields. No duplicates needed!
Add images from the parts to the list.
Power consumption.
Acceleration
Max lift etc.
Correct stats per item
Gravity scaling
Oxygen generator stuff.
Design the tool
Suit hydrogen consumption.
Add stat list separator.

As I was building things, I often found myself lacking in reaching space.
There are enough calculators but none which do what I'd want.
The aim is to make a calculator capable of doing everything that I want it to do, making it the most complete calculator.

This tool should be able to calculate thrust (acceleration and needed thrust) and consumption (hydrogen, oxygen, power).

TODO:
Inventory multipliers/settings
Add images from the parts to the list?
Power consumption.
Gravity scaling
Oxygen generator stuff.
Design the tool
Suit hydrogen consumption.
Possibility to reach space?
Time to reach space!
Incorporate planet stuff.
    Gravitational pull,
    Atmosphere,
    ETC
Progress bar!
